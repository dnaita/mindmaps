<p class="topic-heading"><strong>Understanding Search</strong></p>
<p>With search included in the core of MarkLogic, MarkLogic is able to offer   powerful search abilities in real-time.</p>
<p>MarkLogic's search capabilities include text search,   geospatial search,   semantics search and alerting (reverse search).</p>
<p>Search features include  <span class="exercise-step">facets, type-ahead suggestions, highlighting, snippets,  relevance ranking, document structure-based search, proximity boosting, search term weighting,  wildcards, stemming,    case sensitivity, punctuation sensitivity, and diacritic sensitivity</span>.</p>

<p>In addition to English, MarkLogic offers <span class="exercise-step">tokenization, stemming, and collation for Arabic, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional),  Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Persian (Farsi), Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish</span>.</p>
<p>MarkLogic's text search capabilities can also be used with its geospatial search (and/or semantics search) capabilities to create discovery applications, as well as to visualize data. These applications could even include alerting, for notification of any new items.</p>
