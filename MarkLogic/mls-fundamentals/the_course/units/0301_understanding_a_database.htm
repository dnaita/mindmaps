<p class="topic-heading"><strong>Understanding a Database</strong></p>
<p>In MarkLogic, a database is a set of configurations, which includes a  reference to one or more forests. </p>
<p>A forest is where the documents in a database are physically stored. The name forest comes from the concept of XML documents (which MarkLogic was originally for) having tree-like structures. Hence, the idea of  storing trees in forests.<br>
  <br>

</p>
<p>Although we use the term forest for referring to the location of documents stored in a MarkLogic database, documents in any of the supported file formats (i.e. JSON, XML, RDF, text, or binary) can be stored in a forest.</p>
<p>A forest can only be attached to one database, but a  database can have more than one forest attached to it.</p>
<p>Sizing guidelines (e.g. 2 cores per forest, maximum of 200GB per forest) are available in the Scalability Considerations in MarkLogic Server section of the Scalability, Availability, and Failover Guide (<strong>docs.marklogic.com/guide/cluster/scalability</strong>).</p>
<p>Data cannot be loaded into a database until a forest has been created  and connected to the database.</p>
