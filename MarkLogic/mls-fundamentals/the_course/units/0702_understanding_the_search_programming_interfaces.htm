<p class="topic-heading"><strong>Understanding the Search Programming Interfaces</strong></p>
<p>To allow an application to search the documents in a  MarkLogic database, there are a number of  programming interfaces available. </p>
<p class="topic-sub-heading">cts Functions</p>
<p>At the<strong> lowest level</strong>, are the cts (core text search) functions. The cts functions have always existed in MarkLogic and  serve as the basis for the higher-level  APIs. </p>
<p class="topic-sub-heading">Search API</p>
<p>The Search API, built upon the cts functions, is a higher-level API that includes <strong>best practices</strong> while also providing useful application features such as highlighting, snippets, pagination, and faceting. </p>
<p class="topic-sub-heading">REST API search Service</p>
<p><strong>Built on</strong> the Search API, the REST API search service provides a way to query a database through a REST API instance. This is  quite useful to developers who are using MarkLogic for their database, but writing their application code in a language other than XQuery, JavaScript, or Java. </p>
<p class="topic-sub-heading">Java API and Node.js API</p>
<p><strong>Built on</strong> the REST API, the Java and Node.js APIs provide MarkLogic search capabilities for Java and Node.js developers in their native language.</p>
