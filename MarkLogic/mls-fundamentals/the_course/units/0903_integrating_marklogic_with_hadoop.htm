<p class="topic-heading"><strong>Integrating with Hadoop</strong></p>
<p>MarkLogic can be used with Hadoop, which is a popular offline batch processing technology for analytics.</p>
<p>With Hadoop's ability to cheaply store large amounts of data and run MapReduce jobs on it, and MarkLogic's ability to provide a highly available database for real-time transactions and queries, these two technologies can be integrated to handle both operational and analytic workloads.</p>
<p>With the <strong>MarkLogic Connector for Hadoop</strong>, MarkLogic can be used as a MapReduce input source or output destination. In addition, data can be archived out of a MarkLogic database into  storage on HDFS.</p>
