<p class="topic-heading"><strong>Creating the Course Virtual Machine</strong></p>
<p>The   virtual machine for doing the hands-on exercises in this course is downloadable from MarkLogic University.</p>
<p>For people curious to know how the virtual machine was created, the steps that were done (using VirtualBox 4.3.28 on Windows in November 2015) are provided in this appendix. (Realize that if you go to reproduce these steps at a later date, some of the open source software versions and URLs may have moved on.)</p>
<p>At a high level, the steps that were done to create the  virtual machine for this course were:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Created a CentOS virtual machine.</li>
  <li>Configured CentOS.</li>
  <li>Installed helper applications.</li>
  <li>Installed JDK.</li>
