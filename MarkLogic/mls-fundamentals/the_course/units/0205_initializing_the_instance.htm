<p class="topic-heading"><strong>Initializing the Instance</strong></p>
<p>Once MarkLogic has been installed, and its service started, the final step is to initialize the MarkLogic instance. Initializing the  instance sets up  initial databases and application servers for the MarkLogic instance and, optionally, allows the host to join an existing cluster. This only needs to be done once, when MarkLogic is first installed. </p>
<p>By navigating to port 8001 on the host (e.g. <strong>http://localhost:8001</strong>), a series of screens can be followed to initialize  MarkLogic  on the host. </p>

<p>For setting up a single-host cluster, or the first host in a cluster, the <strong>skip</strong> button in the Join a Cluster screen can be used. </p>

<p>In the Security Setup screen, a user needs to be created. This is, in effect, a super user for the system. </p>

<p>Once a user has been created, an authentication window will display, for the new user to login to MarkLogic's administrative interface.</p>
