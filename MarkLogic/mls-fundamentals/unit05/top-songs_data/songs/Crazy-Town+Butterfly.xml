    <p>"Butterfly" is a rap rock song by Crazy Town from their
    album 
    <i>The Gift of Game</i>that was released in February 2001. It
    reached No. 1 in 15 countries, including the Billboard Hot
    100.</p>
    <p>The song consists mainly of a sample from the Red Hot Chili
    Peppers' song "Pretty Little Ditty" with additional lyrics by
    Shifty Shellshock and Epic Mazur on top.</p>
    <p>The song is referenced in DJ Paul Oakenfold's 2002 song,
    Starry Eyed Surprise, in the line sung by Shifty Shellshock,
    "Freaky deaky, star speckles and pink butterflies", in a
    similar manner to that of "Butterfly".</p>
    <p>"Butterfly" is one of only two No. 1 songs in the Hot 100
    era naming an insect in its title (The other being 
    <i>Fireflies</i>by Owl City)</p>
    <p>The song's music video, directed by Honey, features the band
    in a fantasy-like forest complete with butterflies where Shifty
    Shellshock and Epic Mazur sing their praises to two women with
    butterfly wings. At one point in the video, Shifty's
    star-shaped tattoos fly off into the air.</p>
