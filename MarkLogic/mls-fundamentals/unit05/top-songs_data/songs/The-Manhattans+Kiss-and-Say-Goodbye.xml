    <p>"Kiss And Say Goodbye" is a song recorded by the American
    R&amp;B vocal group The Manhattans. The song was written by
    Manhattans member Winfred "Blue" Lovett. The original demo of
    the song was recorded with The Manhattans backing band, "Little
    Harlem." After hearing a tape of the recording,
    producer/arranger Bobby Martin decided to re-record the song
    with MFSB at Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia. Released as a
    single, in both a version that included a mid-song rap spoken
    part (aimed toward the R&amp;B market) and one that omitted it
    (aimed toward the pop market), over a year later, the song
    became a world-wide hit for the group, spending two weeks at
    number one on the U.S. Pop and U.S. R&amp;B charts. and
    reaching number four on the UK Singles Chart in the summer of
    1976. It also became just the second single to earn
    double-platinum certification status (Johnnie Taylor's "Disco
    Lady" was the first a few months earlier).</p>
