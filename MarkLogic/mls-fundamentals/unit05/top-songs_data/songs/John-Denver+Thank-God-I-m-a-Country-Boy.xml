    <p>"Thank God I'm a Country Boy", also known as "Country Boy"
    is a song written by John Martin Sommers and recorded by
    singer/songwriter John Denver.</p>
    <p>The song was originally included on Denver's 1974 album 
    <i>Back Home Again</i>. A version recorded live at the
    Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles was included on his 1975
    album 
    <i>An Evening With John Denver</i>.</p>
    <p>The live version was released as a single and went to No. 1
    on both the 
    <i>Billboard magazine</i>Hot Country Singles and Billboard Hot
    100 charts. The song topped both charts for one week each,
    first the country chart (on May 31), and the Hot 100 chart a
    week later.</p>
    <p>"Thank God I'm a Country Boy" was one of six songs released
    in 1975 that topped both the Billboard Hot 100 and 
    <i>Billboard</i>Hot Country Singles charts. Denver's two-sided
    hit "I'm Sorry"/"Calypso" also received that distinction.</p>
