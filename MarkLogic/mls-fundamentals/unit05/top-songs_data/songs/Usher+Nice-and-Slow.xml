  <descr>
    <p>"Nice and Slow" is a 1997 single from Usher's second album 
    <i>My Way</i>. It became his first number-one single on the
    Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in early 1998. However, in the
    UK, it did not follow the number one success of "You Make Me
    Wanna," only peaking at #24, therefore becoming the final
    single from the album there. The song was written by Brian
    &amp; Brandon Casey of the R&amp;B group Jagged Edge, Manuel
    Seal Jr., Jermaine Dupri and Usher Raymond.</p>
    <p>The music video for the song featured Kimora Lee
    Simmons.</p>
