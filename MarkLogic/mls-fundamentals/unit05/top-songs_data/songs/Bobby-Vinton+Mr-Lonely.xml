    <p>"Mr. Lonely" is a song co-written and recorded by Bobby
    Vinton. It was released as a single in 1964 and reached #1 on
    the United States charts. The song originally appeared on
    Vinton's album 
    <i>Roses Are Red</i>in 1962. Later that year, Buddy Greco
    recorded a version of the song using the same backing track as
    Vinton's version. Greco's single release reached #64 on the
    Billboard Hot 100 in November 1962.</p>
    <p>Philippine singer Victor Wood made a bilingual version of
    the song, alternating the original lyrics with Filipino ones.
    This particular cover became popular in the Philippines and
    gave some fame to the entertainer.</p>
    <p>In 2005, Senegalese singer Akon sampled this single for
    Lonely and it was featured on his album 
    <i>Trouble</i>. This song uses a sped-up sample of the earlier
    song.</p>
